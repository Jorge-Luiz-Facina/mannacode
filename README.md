# mannacode

mannacode is a platform prototype created in early 2021 to create programming challenges in multiplayer or class models, the models can help teachers, developers and companies in the education and programming environment.

The multiplayer model is used to challenge players in real time in an online room.
The class template is used to leave challenges created for the class to be able to solve by the date that was stipulated.

Both models have configurable settings for displaying player ratings and scores.

It currently has four programming languages, Python, Java, C# and JavaScript.
